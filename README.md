# UBC Food App

## Description of Project

Our application is designed to make food at UBC-affiliated restaurants more affordable and satisfying for UBC students. By storing data about different restaurants and coupons, we enable students to buy tastier and more affordable food on campus.

Students can:

*   Create an order
*   View coupons offered by UBC-affiliated restaurants
*   Provide feedback about these restaurants

## Order Management

Students can place orders given that they have a valid account that is linked to a UBC student number, to ensure only UBC students can use this app. They can select the restaurant, branch (by address), coupon, food, and quantity for their order, and also specify a payment method (e.g., Cash, Credit, Debit). There is also “restaurants of the day” table shown on the order page, and anyone who has visited all of the restaurants of the day gets their name on a “leaderboard” type table, to encourage students to try new places. Finally, users can view their total payments, where they can see the total costs for every order they’ve made, summing up all of the foods with the given quantities, delivery charges, etc.

## Coupon Management

Coupons are available on a first-come, first-served basis, as their availability is determined by the number of uses remaining. Each coupon used within an order decreases its remaining uses by one, until no uses are left and the coupon is deleted from the table. In the coupon page, students are able to view the coupons that are offered from each restaurant and search for specific coupons available, project attributes of coupons that they wish to see and see good deal coupons offered by each restaurant.

## Feedback Management

Students can provide feedback on their dining experiences at relevant restaurants. They can submit new feedback, which includes their account ID, student ID, order date, branch ID, and a rating. Students can also update their existing feedback if needed. Additionally, students can view all feedback associated with their account ID. To help students identify the best restaurants, the application allows them to view the best-rated branch based on average feedback ratings.
